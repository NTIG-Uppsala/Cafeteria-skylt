# Tips

## data-interval
```
data-interval="10000" determines how many milliseconds have to pass before it changes to the next slide, 10000ms is 10 seconds
```

## id
 
 ```
id="productImage" is only used to position images.
The id for dot.png and money-dot.png is recommended to be used for all slides as they position the purple bubbles with the price on.
Id:s that are used to position a product can be created and adjusted but make sure that the whole image is within the bubble.
Make sure that the product's id has "z-index: 1;" so that it is on the correct layer. 

id="itemText" is used to position the text and to put the text on the top layer.
This should not be changed although depending on the length of the text a new id may be necessary.
Make sure that the price is always in the bubble.
